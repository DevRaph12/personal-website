# personal-website
I've been studying HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and I decided to create a personal project on my own, combining all of these technologies and my knowledge to see what would be the result and I am Happy with it so if you can just take a look at it and let me know what you think about it. I'm currently learning Javascript so that just the beggining.
